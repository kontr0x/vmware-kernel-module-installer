# vmware-kernel-module-installer
Simple VMWare kernel module installer script.

This script uses the [repo from mkubecek](https://github.com/mkubecek/vmware-host-modules) to automate the installation of his provided host modules.

This script becomes handy when you come to the issue that after an VMWare installation, the program won't launch because of missing modules, which won't be installed on some systems.
