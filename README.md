# vmware-kernel-module-installer
Simple VMware kernel module installer script.

This script uses the [repo from mkubecek](https://github.com/mkubecek/vmware-host-modules) to automate the installation of his provided host modules.

This script becomes handy when the VMware installation won't launch because of missing kernel modules, which won't be installed on some systems.

Tested the script on:
- fedora
